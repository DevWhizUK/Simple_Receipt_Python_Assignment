# Chi Cleaners Point of Sale System

## Overview

This project is a Python-based prototype program developed as part of an assignment to automate the point of sale (POS) operations for Chi Cleaners, a dry-cleaning service provider. The program is designed to help staff manage customer orders, calculate total costs, apply discounts, calculate VAT, generate receipts, and create item tags for tracking during the cleaning process.

## Assignment Description

Chi Cleaners offers two types of services: standard and specialist, across two categories: Ladies and Gentlemen. The goal of the assignment was to:

1. **Design and develop a procedural Python program** to simulate the POS operations for a single customer.
2. **Generate a customer receipt** showing the total number of items, the total cost of services, separate VAT calculation, and applicable discounts.
3. **Generate tags** for each item, incorporating the date, time, and type of service for identification during the cleaning process.

## Features

- **Menu Display**: Shows the available services and prices in a tabulated format for easy reference.
- **Order Management**: Allows staff to add multiple items to a customer's order, specifying the category, service type, and item.
- **Receipt Generation**: Calculates the total cost, applies discounts, computes VAT, and generates a detailed receipt saved to a file.
- **Tag Generation**: Creates tags for each item in the order, with a unique identifier based on the date, time, and service type, saved to a file.
